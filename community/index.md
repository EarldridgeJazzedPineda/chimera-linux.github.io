Chimera Linux is a free software project. If you wish to participate, there
are several ways you can do so.

## Communication channels

Our primary means of communication is IRC. The primary and currently only
IRC channel is `#chimera-linux` on the OFTC network.

You can find OFTC [here](https://oftc.net). You can use any IRC client
compatible with the network, as well as their web chat. It is highly
encouraged to idle in the channel (by e.g. using a bouncer) rather than
re-connecting, especially if you have questions, as it may take a while
to get answers (people do not always monitor their chats).

The secondary channel is on Matrix, at `#chimera-linux:matrix.org`. The channels
are linked, so you can use whichever you prefer. Messages are relayed between
them transparently.

We ask you to refrain from using advanced Matrix features, such as reactions,
editing, message removal, markup and multi-line messages while using the chat.
This is because users on IRC side will either not see that or it will clutter
the channel. Stick to simple, plain text messages, like you would if you were
on IRC.

Neither channel is logged by the project. Keep in mind that other users might
be keeping their own logs though.

## Other public spaces

These are official:

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/chimeralinux)
* [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@chimera_linux)

Unless listed here, anything else is an unofficial space. Creation of such
spaces is discouraged by the project. Please do not create them. If there
is enough demand, more official spaces may be created, but please seek
approval first.

## Contributing

We are always looking for contributors. Anyone can contribute, regardless
of their experience level. Examples of contributing include:

* Packaging
* Testing
* Website work
* Infrastructure work
* Porting to new platforms
* Spreading the word
* Hanging around

If you wish to contribute technical work, you should first pick the part
of the project you want to contribute into (each has their repository)
and read its documentation. If you need help, you can always ask in one
of the official channels. See the [Development](/development) page for more.

## Conduct

Chimera is informally organized. In places where that makes sense, notably
the realtime chat channels, there is no emphasis on keeping things on-topic.
A fun and casual environment is better than a boring one, and most topics
are okay. After all, a lot of people do not participate in FOSS strictly
for the technical efforts, but also to have a comfortable community space
where they can interact with like-minded people.

This should not be interpreted as a permission to behave in a toxic manner.
It is not just you, and therefore it is extremely important to keep standards
high.

If a conflict happens, or if you have any kind of concern, don't be afraid to
raise it - things cannot be fixed if nobody knows anything is wrong, and
bottled up conflicts are bad for the community as a whole. If you for some
reason cannot do that in public, contacting anybody with moderator rights
in private is alright too.

Notably, unwarranted personal attacks or any kind of harassment for any reason
are not tolerated. Additionally, participants are fully expected to observe the
same level of standards both in and outside of the project spaces, especially if
they are contributors or otherwise active. Harmful views that negatively affect
any (and particularly those that are marginalized in some way) group of people
(this does not include those intentionally causing harm themselves) are not
welcome in the project, and keeping good conduct within the project alone is
simply not enough.

Overtly malicious behavior is usually clear, but in other cases there may be
some doubt. When that happens, it is usually better to assume good intentions
by default, especially in a project that has members all over the world and
language barrier may create ambiguous situations. Clearing things up before
an intervention is necessary is always better than unnecessary conflict.

All violations will be handled based on their severity by anybody in power who
is available, and may range from a warning to an expulsion. If you feel you
have been wronged, you can appeal to anybody with global access rights, and
your case will be re-evaluated.

Specific examples of things considered harmful and not welcome:

* Far-right and adjacent movements, tankies, putinists and other
  equivalent authoritarian chuddery
* Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.
* Complaining about SJWs
* Loud anti-systemd nonsense, dogmatic suckless/"minimalism",
  cat-v, cryptocurrencies and other sketchy religious movements
* etc.
